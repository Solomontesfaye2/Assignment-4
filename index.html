    <p1>I chose Computer Engineering because it is theorized, design, develop, and apply the software and hardware for the programs we use day in day out. Such a creative field it is, studying computer engineering helps you widen your creative horizon and provide solutions to the problems people haven't thought about yet.
Computer engineering is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture. In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.
 Education required for a computer engineering
Completion of high school is required for admission to most diploma and certificate programs in computer engineering, with the completion (and an average of at least 60%) of English, math, and physics. Computer literacy is an asset.</p1>

<center><h3 style="color:red">Computer science job outlook Canada
</h3></center>
<p3>The job market is quite stable and has numerous opportunities for computer science graduates. There is a high demand for programmers and software engineers. If you are seeking to work in Canada, now is the time to apply.
In order to determine the expected outlook of occupation, the magnitude of the difference between the projected total numbers of new job seekers and job openings over the whole projection period (2019-2028) is analyzed in conjunction with an assessment of labor market conditions in recent years. The intention is to determine if recent labor market conditions 
(surplus, balance, or shortage) are expected to persist or change over the period 2019-2028. For instance, if the analysis of key labor market indicators suggests that the number of job seekers was insufficient to fill the job openings (a shortage of workers) in an occupational group in recent years, the projections are used to assess if this situation will continue over the projection period or if the occupation will move towards balanced conditions.</p3>

</h3></center>
<p4>The average salary for a computer engineer is $75,853 per year in Canada.
 </p4>
 <center><h3 style="color:green">Why is computer engineering interesting</h3></center>
<p5> It's awesome because it provides the opportunity to create something brand new and to develop the mental ability to attack difficult problems in a variety of fields—from biology to economics and even to literature. Computer Engineering has always been one of the top in-demand career choices for young aspirants. This is primarily because the field branches out into numerous specializations, thereby creating a host of career paths for Computer Engineers.

<center><h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How will your vocation enable you to sets appropriate goals and priorities in school, work, and personal life?</h3></center>
<p9>Things we do may move us closer to or farther away from that result. Studying moves us closer to success in a difficult course, while sleeping through the final examination may completely prevent reaching that goal. That’s fairly obvious in an extreme case, yet still, a lot of college students don’t reach their goal of graduating. The problem may be a lack of commitment to the goal, but often students have conflicting goals. One way to prevent problems is to think about all your goals and priorities and to learn ways to manage your time, your studies, and your social life to best reach your goals.
